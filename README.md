Hey there 👋

I’m Gargi, an M.S. Computer Software Engineering student based in the United States.

I build software systems and full-stack applications, and I enjoy adding AI where
it actually makes sense. If an idea sticks in my head, I usually end up building
it and shipping it.

Most of my work lives around Python, React, Node.js, SQL, and applied AI projects
(NLP, Transformers, PyTorch). I care about clean design, solid backend logic, and
projects that feel complete, not half-done demos.

When I’m not coding, I’m into escape games, Studio Ghibli films, Pilates, and
working to lofi beats.
