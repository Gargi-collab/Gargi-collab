Hey there 👋

I’m Gargi, an M.S. Computer Software Engineering student based in the United States.

I design and build software systems, mostly full-stack applications,
and I enjoy adding AI where it actually makes sense.

If an idea sticks in my head,
chances are I’ll build it and ship it.


Most of my work revolves around:

• Python, React, Node.js, and SQL  
• Backend APIs and system design  
• Applied AI projects (NLP, Transformers, PyTorch)


Outside of coding, I enjoy escape games,
Studio Ghibli films, Pilates,
and working to lofi beats.
