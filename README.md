Hey there 👋🏻

I’m Gargi, an M.S. Computer Software Engineering student based in the United States.

I build software systems and full-stack applications. If an idea sticks in my head, I usually end up building it and shipping it.

If an idea sticks in my head, chances are I’ll build it and ship it.


Most of my work revolves around:

• Python, React, JavaScript, Node.js, and SQL  
• Backend APIs and system design  
• Applied AI projects (NLP, Transformers, PyTorch)


Outside of coding, I enjoy escape games,
Studio Ghibli films, Pilates,
and working to lofi beats.
